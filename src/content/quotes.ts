    text: `À Léon Werth

Je demande pardon aux enfants d’avoir dédié ce livre à une grande personne. J’ai une excuse sérieuse: cette grande personne est le meilleur ami que j’ai au monde. J’ai une autre excuse: cette grande personne peut tout comprendre, même les livres pour enfants. J’ai une troisième excuse: cette grande personne habite la France où elle a faim et froid. Elle a bien besoin d’être consolée. Si toutes ces excuses ne suffisent pas, je veux bien dédier ce livre à l’enfant qu’a été autrefois cette grande personne. Toutes les grandes personnes ont d’abord été des enfants. (Mais peu d’entre elles s’en souviennent.) Je corrige donc ma dédicace:

À Léon Werth

But when they cleared the lee of the land and entered the seaway, and the boat suddenly began to lurch, they grabbed the nearest sturdy things and thought about their suppers, which by the time it got dark, several of them had lost.",

  Of cheat and charmer
  Came clad in armour
      By stars benign.
Hope lies to mortals
  And most believe her
  But man's deceiver
      Was never mine.

The thoughts of others
  Were light and fleeting,
  Of lovers' meeting
      Or luck or fame.
Mine were of trouble,
    And mine were steady,
    So I was ready
        When trouble came.`,

Will never buy back your soul`,

und sahen sich an und wussten nicht weiter.
Da weinte sie schließlich. Und er stand dabei.`,
